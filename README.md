ITVX for Kodi
=============

Project for the development of plugin.video.viwx - an add-on for 
[Kodi media center](https://kodi.tv) enabling access to live and video 
on-demand from ITVX; the web streaming service of British broadcaster ITV. 

This is an unofficial add-on. It is not created or endorsed by ITV, nor is 
the developer in any way associated with ITV. The add-on just provides 
access to ITV's web services from Kodi, so the same limitations encountered
with a generic web browser also apply to this add-on:
  * You can only watch ITVX in the UK.
  * You need an ITVX account to watch live or VOD content. 


## Features

* Watch the main ITV live channels.
* Watch the stream-only FAST channels.
* Watch all video on-demand offered by ITVX. Premium content is of course only 
  available to users with a paid ITVX premium account.
* Search
* Play from the start for programmes on the main live channels.  
  Available from the context menu on channels in the 'Live' menu.
* My ItvX with:
  * Support for ITVX's My List.  
    Add to or remove programmes from My List by using the context menu on 
    programmes in any type of listing.  
  * Continue Watching with synced status across different devices.  
    Resume watching on one device what you started on another, regardless of 
    whether it's viwX, the ITVX app or the ITVX website.
  * Because You Watched.  
    ITVX's recommendations based on a recently watched programme.
  * Recommended for You.  
    General recommendations from ITVX.
* Option to hide premium content from listings.
* Option to show subtitles on VOD content, with the option to enable/disable 
  colourisation of subtitles.
* Support for embedded subtitles on live streams.


## Installation

Only Kodi 19 (Matrix) and higher are supported.


#### Preferred Method

ViwX is available in the official Kodi add-on repository. Installing from the 
Kodi repo is the easiest and most secure way of installing this add-on, and is 
the only method that supports automatic updates. 

To install from the official Kodi repo, select `Settings -> Add-ons -> Install 
from repository -> Kodi Add-on repository -> Video add-ons`. Scroll down to 
viwX, select and install.

After installation, open the add-on's settings to sign in to your ITVX 
account.


#### Alternative Method

For those who prefer to install add-ons manually, or want immediate access to 
new versions, this method of installing from zip remains available:

* Ensure that installing from unknown sources is enabled in Kodi. Click here for
  [instructions](https://dimkroon.net/en/guides/enable-unknown-sources.html).
* Download the latest release. 
  You can add https://dimkroon.net/kodi-addons as file source to Kodi's file 
  manager ([instructions](https://dimkroon.net/en/guides/howto-add-file-source.html)), 
  so you can easily download the zip file from Kodi.
  Alternatively, download the latest zip file manually from the
  [GitHub releases](https://github.com/dimkroon/itvx-for-kodi/releases) 
  page to a place that is accessible by your Kodi device.
* Choose _install from zip_ from Kodi's add-on menu, browse to the file 
  source you've just created and install the latest version, or install the 
  manually downloaded zip file.
